Django JanySON
==============

Store additional model fields as JSON object in PostgreSQL's `jsonb` field and work with them as regular model fields. Need new boolean/text/foreign key/many-to-many/etc. field? Just add the decorator with the field description to your model. It's all! No more annoying migrations.
